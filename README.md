Final Group Project

This repository has files and codes that were used to reproduce the ***Gene expression analysis of porcine whole blood cells infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus using high-throughput sequencing technology*** by Ding et al., 2018.

We shared roles and responsibilities amongst ourselves and each member reproduced a particular figure in the paper
- Fig.1 was to be reproduced by `Ann Murithi`; but since we did not have data for gene expression of all the genes, it was non-reporducible. She used the available data to look at the ***Distribution of gene length*** and also looking at how it varried between the two major groups (The infected and Non-Infected)
- Fig.2 was reproduced by `Stephen Gray` but since we did not have sufficient data for that was used, the available data could only reproduce and annotate a few genes to her pathways on the Gene Ontology figure. He used Entrez to retrieve the pprovided GeneIDs.
- Fig.3 was reproduced by `Ceren Ordas` about ***KEGG annotation of differentially expressed genes*** but the paper did not mention theh software they used for this. She thus used pathfindR package in ShinyGO 0.76 web application and made the chart using RStudio
- Fig.4 was reproduced by `Fazhir Kayondo` (Me) about ***Relative expression levels of 10 randomly selected DEGs***
- Fig.5 was not reproduced due to lack of data regarding the IgG titers, but the available data was utilized by `Mercy Fakude` to produce a new figure for ***Quality scores across all bases*** and another one for ***Total GC content quality***
